## Project Overview

The *Rewards Points Calculator* is a simple web-based application designed to calculate reward points earned by users based on their transactions. The system allows retailers or businesses to reward customers based on their purchasing behavior. This project demonstrates the calculation of rewards based on the spending amounts provided by users and can be easily adapted or expanded to handle complex reward structures.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the application, including installation instructions, code structure, and configuration options.

## Features

- *Simple and intuitive user interface*: Designed for ease of use and clarity.
- *Automated reward calculation*: Calculates reward points based on the amount spent.
- *Support for multiple transactions*: Handles multiple transactions at once and displays cumulative reward points.
- *Responsive design*: The web interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile usage.
- *Modular and scalable*: The application is designed in a modular way, allowing easy expansion for more complex business requirements.

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- *Backend*: Node.js (Express.js)
- *Database*: JSON (for demonstration purposes, easily replaceable with any DB like MongoDB or MySQL)
- *Version Control*: Git
- *Deployment*: GitHub, Local Environment

## System Requirements

To run this project, you need the following tools installed:

- *Node.js* (v14.x or above) - [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- *npm* (v6.x or above) - Comes with Node.js
- *Git* - [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Optional:

- *VS Code* - [Download and Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- *Postman* (for API testing) - [Download and Install Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the repository*:
   Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/raheem04/reward-points-calculator.git
   cd reward-points-calculator
   

2. *Install dependencies*:
   After navigating to the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm:

   bash
   npm install
   

3. *Run the application*:
   To run the application in a local development environment:

   bash
   npm start
   

   This will start the application on localhost:3000. You can view the application by opening your browser and going to:

   
   http://localhost:3000
   

## Configuration

The application comes with a basic configuration that you can modify based on your needs.

1. *Port*: The server runs on port 3000 by default. If you wish to change this, modify the PORT value in the .env file (create this file if it doesn’t exist):

   bash
   PORT=4000
   

2. *Rewards calculation rules*:
   - You can modify the calculation logic in the backend (rewardsCalculator.js) if you have custom reward schemes.
   - The default reward structure awards points for spending over specific thresholds (e.g., $50 or $100).

## Usage

1. *Web Application*:
   - Navigate to the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
   - Input the transaction amount, and the system will calculate the reward points based on predefined thresholds.
   - Submit multiple transactions and see the cumulative rewards.
   - Clear the input to reset the calculation.

2. *API Endpoints* (if using a RESTful API):

   - POST /calculate - Calculate reward points based on transaction details provided in the request body.

   Example request:
   json
   {
     "transactions": [100, 60, 120]
   }
   

   Example response:
   json
   {
     "totalPoints": 130
   }
   

## Code Structure

The project follows a basic MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for ease of expansion and maintenance. Below is an overview of the folder structure:


reward-points-calculator/
├── public/
│   ├── css/                # Stylesheets (CSS files)
│   ├── js/                 # Frontend JavaScript files
│   └── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/        # Request handlers
│   ├── models/             # Data models and logic (e.g., rewardsCalculator.js)
│   ├── routes/             # Route handlers
│   └── app.js              # Main application file (Express server)
├── .gitignore              # Files to ignore in Git
├── package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation


### Key Files:

- **app.js**: The main file that sets up the server and routes.
- **rewardsCalculator.js**: Contains the core logic for calculating reward points.
- **index.html**: The main frontend file where users input transaction amounts.

## Testing

### Unit Tests:

We have implemented unit tests for the core functionality of the rewards points calculator. To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
npm test


The tests are located in the tests/ directory. We use *Jest* for unit testing, but this can be extended to other testing frameworks if required.

### Manual Testing:

- *Step 1*: Open the application in the browser.
- *Step 2*: Input transaction amounts and verify the reward points calculation.
- *Step 3*: Submit multiple transactions and verify that the cumulative reward points are calculated correctly.
- *Step 4: Use API testing tools like **Postman* to manually test API endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- *Error: Port 3000 is already in use*:
  - This means another application is running on port 3000. Either stop the conflicting service or run your application on a different port by changing the port in the .env file.

- *Error: Cannot find module 'express'*:
  - This occurs if dependencies are not installed. Run npm install to install all dependencies.

- *CORS Issues*:
  - If you're using an API and encountering CORS issues, you may need to configure CORS in your backend (app.js) using middleware like cors.
